**Topic**:  Partisan Gerrymandering:  Can Algorithms Solve a Problem Exacerbated by Other Algorithms?
*Create a presentation giving an overview of the issue, why it should be addressed, and possible solutions. The presentation should include program-based examples illustrating the problem and where appropriate to address solutions.Depending on topic, each team may de/emphasize different portions.*

**Brief Overview**: 
*The U.S. Supreme Court found gerrymandering should not be controlled by the Judicial Branch.  Several local courts have stricken down gerrymandering as a result of analysis by modern algorithms, however.
*This redistricting is widespread.
*It is often done by algorithm by both Democrats and Republics to keep and gain political power.

**This is why it should be addressed**:
Some have argued that redistricting to favor incumbents and strategically advance parties minimizes the impact of any one citizen to impact a democratic election.  

**These are possible solutions**:
These are program-based examples illustrating the problem and addressing solutions:  Example to counter gerrymandering:  redist.  The industry standard gerrymandering software is Maptitude, made by Caliper
*GUIDING GOAL: Leave your classmates with something they can incorporate into their own praxis. This could be a turn-key day/unit plan, code snippets or full working programs, or something more abstract. You know your audienceâ€¦*

**Goal**:  We could leave our classmates with specific information - ideally actual code - relating to the algorithms that are designed to identify gerrymandering along with explanatory comments.
*DELIVERABLE:  PDF of presentation (I.e., If you make a slide deck, export it to a PDF version.) optional: slide deck or other content in its original format (slide deck, document, etc) Any code you use or cite. Location/format: <reporoot>/final_project/*

**Deliverable**:  We could make our slide deck into a PDF.

**Notes on the code aspect**: *There must be a code component to your final project. This code component does not have to be polished but it should be used to either explore, illustrate your topic. This may be done in any programming language (including using spreadsheets for number crunching).*
It would be great if we could obtain and understand some of the anti-gerrymandering code and work with that.  Some of the redist anti-gerrymandering code on Git Hub, and it looks like some of it is written in r.  It could be fun to learn a little r and try to work through that.
